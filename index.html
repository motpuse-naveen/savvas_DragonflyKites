                    <p>Joe and Cody are Cree brothers who live in the far north of Canada. Their summer home is a tent. Each summer the boys and their parents stay in a different spot on the hundreds of lakes and islands in northern Manitoba. There are no other people in this wilderness—just the brothers, mama and papa, and Cody’s dog, Ootsie. While mama and papa fish, Joe and Cody entertain themselves using the natural objects and animals around them. They make up names for sticks and stones. They play with these “new friends”—talking to them, singing and dancing with them, and even making breakfast for them. They treat the objects as friends. *</p>

                        <li>The book is set in Canada, in the province of Manitoba.</li>

                        <li>This part of Canada has many lakes, and the indigenous people in that area often travel in boats called canoes.</li>

                            <p>This map shows the province of Manitoba. Tomson Highway grew up in the area of Reindeer Lake, on the northern border of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Point out that people of the Cree Nation live in this part of Canada, and that the province names Manitoba and Saskatchewan are words from indigenous languages. </p>
                            <p>Have students record two or three thoughts about Manitoba and the northern location of Reindeer Lake.Then have students discuss the map with a partner before discussing as a whole class. </p>

                    <p>Have partners discuss how the wilderness setting inspires Joe and Cody to use their imaginations. Ask students to talk about what it might be like to be in a setting like this without any modern toys or devices, such as videos, computers, cell phones, or TVs.

                    <p>One summer, Joe and Cody befriend a baby Arctic tern, whom they call Freddy. Another summer, they befriend a baby loon whom they name Sally. The boys make friends and name other small animals, including squirrels, rabbits, chipmunks, and even ants. The animals eat from the boys’ hands. The brothers become friends with two baby eagles, naming one Migisoo, the Cree word for “eagle,” and playfully name the other baby eagle Wagisoo, a made-up word that rhymes with the Cree name. *</p>

                    <p>In this video, Randy Morin, a member of the Big River First Nation in Saskatchewan, gives a brief, friendly introduction to five Cree words. Set a purpose for viewing by asking students to record two to three things they notice and/or wonder about the Cree language as they watch the video. </p>
                        <p>Once students have viewed the video, discuss what they noticed or wondered about the Cree language, especially its rhythms and musicality. </p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Ask:</span> How would you describe the sounds of the Cree words? Do they sound happy, serious, or musical? Which words would you like to learn? Why?</p>

                        <p>https://www.southernnetwork.org/site/seven-teachings</p>
                        <p>This interactive web page introduces the Seven Teachings—important guiding principles adopted by many indigenous groups. Each teaching focuses on one principle and is represented by a different animal, with the exception of Honesty, represented by Sabe. (Sabe, also called Sasquatch, is an ape-like creature whose existence is rooted in indigenous legend.) Use the web page to build background on core values of many indigenous people, and to show how these values and teachings are connected to nature.</p>
                        <p>Display the web page on a large monitor screen or white board so that students can easily view it. You can navigate from one law to the next, by clicking on the animal’s icon above each value. The full teaching will appear. You may want to preview the meanings of some of the words used in the text, such as “principles,” “wisdom,” and “humility.” Finally, read aloud the text as you display each of The Seven Sacred Laws.</p>
                        <p>Once students have viewed the interactive webpage, discuss what they noticed or wondered about The Seven Teachings.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">Ask:</span> How are the laws connected to nature? Why do you think each animal was chosen to represent that particular law?</p>

                        <h2>Mirrors & Windows</h2>
                        <p>Joe and Cody’s connection with nature is central to their fun and play. Giving names to animals and objects is a form of respect—placing the creatures and objects on the same level as the boys. </p>
                        <p>Turn students’ attention to pages 16–17. Have partners reread the text and look closely at the illustration. Then have partners discuss what this episode shows about Joe and Cody and the importance of nature in their lives. Use questions such as the following:</p>
                       
                       <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>What clue in the text lets you know that Joe and Cody are Cree Nation indigenous people? <i>(They use a Cree word, “migisoo,” to name one of the baby eagles.)</i></li>
                        <li>Why do you think the brothers give names to the animals and other things from nature? <i>(to show that the animals are their friends; because they feel the animals are the same as they are)</i></li>
                        <li>Joe and Cody use the made-up word “Wagisoo” for the other baby eagle. What does this tell you about Joe and Cody? <i>(They are playful. They like to rhyme and have fun with language.)</i></li>
                        <li>What is another way that the boys are showing respect for their eagle friends? <i>(They are just observing the eagles. They stay a good distance away from them and watch them.)</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With the whole class, discuss what the brother’s friendships with the animals tells readers about the importance of respecting and connecting with nature. </p>
                            <h2>Write About It! </h2>
                          <p><span class="bold">Journal</span> Remind students that the eagle represents one of the Seven Teachings of indigenous people—the law of Love. Recall the text of the law: “With Love, all things are possible.” Have students write a few sentences in their Journals about how Joe and Cody show their love of nature and the Earth in the story and what students think of this special connection.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">Sentence Frame</span> I can tell that Joe and Cody love nature because  <span class="longl">________</span> . This tells me that they  <span class="longl">__________</span> . I would show love and respect for nature by <span class="longl">________</span> . </p>
                        <p><i> If students need more prompting, discuss ways in which they show respect and love for family members, friends, and other people. You may also want to display a student exemplar such as the following.  </i></p>
    
                        <h3>Student Exemplars:</h3>
                        <p>“I can tell that Joe and Cody love nature because they give names to rocks, sticks, and animals. This tells me that they think animals are the same as people. I would show love and respect for nature by being careful not to harm animals or the places where they live.”</p>
                       
                        <h2>Revisit the Big Question</h2>
                        <p>Give students time to think about the Big Question and the web that you began with students about ways to connect with nature. Encourage students to add any ideas inspired by the details in this part of the story. This can be done with the whole class or in pairs, with students making their own copies of the web.</p>

                    <p>Of all the creatures that Joe and Cody befriend in their summer homes, dragonflies are their favorite. The boys catch two dragonflies and gently tie thread from their mother’s sewing kit around the middle of each dragonfly’s body. Then the boys let the dragonflies fly away, as the boys hold onto the thread. They create dragonfly kites. The boys and Ootsie follow on the ground as the dragonflies fly above them. The boys follow their “magic kites” through the meadows and by the trees to the lake’s edge. There they release the strings and wave goodbye to the dragonflies. Later that night, the boys lie sleeping in their tent and dream about dragonfly kites. The boys magically run behind the kites, across the beach and onto the water, hopping from wave to wave. They bounce over the islands and leap over the trees with the dragonflies above them at the end of long, long strings. The boys jump so high, they don’t come down. They fly off with their kites into the colorful northern sunset, laughing all the way. *</p>

                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Plot Overview</h2>
                                <p>Joe and Cody live with their parents in northern Manitoba, Canada. The family is Cree First Nation. In the summer, their home is a tent, and they canoe among the islands on the many lakes of the remote wilderness, moving from one location to another. The boy’s only other companion is Cody’s dog, Ootsie.  </p>
                                <p>During the day, mama and papa fish, and the brothers and Ootsie play in the surrounding wilderness. The boys collect rocks and stones and make up games. They also name and befriend the small animals around them.</p>
                                 <p>Of all their animal friends, their favorites are the dragonflies. The boys catch two dragonflies and gently tie them with light threads from mama’s sewing kit. Then the boys hold onto the threads and let the dragonflies go. These “dragonfly kites” soar above the boys, leading them and Ootsie through the trees and meadows and down to the beach, where the boys let their “kites” go. </p>
                                <p>That night, as the boys sleep, the dragonfly kites appear in their dreams. The boys follow their friends, leaping over the waves and lakes and islands—then soaring into the sky and disappearing into the gold and pink northern sunset, laughing and laughing.</p>
                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Theme Overview </h2>
                                <p><span class="bold">Reverence for the Natural World</span> A central theme of <i>Dragonfly Kites</i> is reverence for nature, particularly by indigenous cultures. The main characters, Joe and Cody, are Cree First Nation. They spend all their time in the outdoors. They are closely connected to the land, water, and wildlife that surrounds them. They name and hand-feed familiar small animals and, as the story’s title indicates, play with dragonflies. Their parents fish for the family’s food, and the family moves frequently among the islands and lakes of the remote wilderness of northern Manitoba. Reverence for and connection with nature is central to this Cree family’s way of life. </p>
                               <p>Note that while the text does not explicitly identify Joe and Cody’s family as Cree, the author provides details that allow this conclusion. On page 16, the boys use a Cree word for “eagle” (migisoo) as the name for a baby eagle. The Cree language version of the story is included on every page. Finally, the author, Tomson Highway, grew up in a nomadic family in northern Manitoba, like the family in the story. Highway’s first language is Cree. </p>
                               <p><span class="bold">Imagination</span> In the story, Joe and Cody have no distractions of the modern world—no radios, TVs, computers, or cell phones. Yet, the boys are never bored. The source of their entertainment is their imagination and resourcefulness, inspired by the nature around them. Throughout the book, the boys create their own fun using objects from nature such as rocks and sticks. They name and befriend the small animals around them, including the dragonflies. The brothers’ imagination is engaged both when they are awake and asleep—as their dream life is central to the ending of the story.</p>
                               <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Sensitivity Issues</h2>
                                <p><span class="bold">Referring to Indigenous People</span> Both the author of and the characters in <i>Dragonfly Kites</i> are Cree—a First Nation people in the part of North America that is now Canada. The book is set in the Canadian province of Manitoba. For those reasons, this lesson uses terms for indigenous people more customarily in use in Canada. In Canada, “indigenous” is an umbrella term for First Nations, Métis, and Inuit, and is used that way in this lesson. The Cree are considered a First Nation group. Students in schools in the United States may not be as familiar with these terms for indigenous peoples of North America. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.queensu.ca/indigenous/ways-knowing/terminology-guide">See this article for more background on this topic.</a></p>

                            <p>The Four Corners activity asks students to reflect on quotes about respecting and connecting with nature.

                            <p>You might share situations in your life where your own pride or sense of self helped you overcome a difficult situation. For example, “When I was in fifth grade, classmates made fun of me because they thought my singing sounded funny. I ignored them and just sang louder and prouder!” </p>
                            <p>1.Now pose this question: Why might feeling proud of who you are help you deal with a problem like bullying?</p>
                           <p>2. Have students think about this question on their own, and then turn and talk to discuss it with a partner. Then, have partners discuss the question with the whole class. (Note that some students may not feel comfortable sharing experiences with bullying. In that case, they can discuss the question as it relates to the two videos that they viewed.)</p>
                           <p>3. Prompt the whole class discussion with guiding questions such as the following: </p>

                               <li>How does Faizah feel when she first hears the bully laughing at Asiya? Why? <i> (Faizah doesn’t understand it; she asks why; she can’t understand why others don’t see Asiya’s hijab the same way she does—proud and beautiful.)</i></li>
                               <li>How are Faizah’s reactions to the bullying different from Asiya’s? <i> (Asiya and her friends calmly go back to playing tag; Faizah gets mad)</i></li>
                               <li>What might Faizah learn from Asiya about dealing with bullies? How does feeling proud help both girls? <i> (Faizah learns to stay proud of herself and ignore the bullies. This helps both Asiya and Faizah let go of the hurtful words.)</i></li>
                                <li>Have you ever had to overcome a big challenge like this? How did it make you feel about yourself?</li>
